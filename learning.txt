one important thing I’ve learned in this course is how to use Git for version control. I now understand how the git add command is used to stage changes I’ve made to files, preparing them to be saved. After that, the git push command is used to upload those changes from my local computer to a remote repository like GitHub. This process helps me keep track of my work, collaborate with others, and avoid losing progress. Learning these basic Git commands has improved the way I manage and organize my coding projects
